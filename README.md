#Aether

Aether Plugin for Bukkit. To be used with a texture pack [like this one](http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/aether-texture-pack-14-update/).

Type `!aether` in chat to go to the Aether!

If you mine Iron Ore (*Zanite*), it will drop the ingot.
If you right-click Coal (*Ambrosium*), you will eat it.
